    "\n",
    "**Statements**:\n",
    "1. If Alphabet reported Q3 2024 revenue growth of 15% for Google Services and 35% for Google Cloud with strong operating margins, then the stock price is likely to increase, because these metrics suggest robust financial performance, exceeding market expectations, and highlight Alphabet's growing dominance in high-margin cloud services.\n",
    "2. If Alphabet's consolidated net income grew 34% to $26.3 billion and EPS rose 37%, with operating margins expanding to 32%, then the stock price is likely to increase, because these financial metrics exceed expectations and demonstrate effective cost management, boosting investor sentiment.\n",
    "3. If Alphabet plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, maintaining $13 billion in CapEx for Q4 and increasing in 2025, then the stock price could face slight pressure, because while such investments signal long-term growth, short-term investors may worry about increased expenses impacting near-term profitability.\n",

    "### **Output Example**:\n",
    "Analysis: Alphabet's Q3 earnings reflect robust financial performance, with strong revenue growth in Google Services and Cloud and significant EPS increases.

      "The expert's prediction of \"Moderate Positive\" matched the actual stock movement, which was also \"Moderate Positive.\" The primary driver for the prediction was the significant growth in Google's core revenue streams, particularly the 18% year-over-year increase in sites revenue and a strong performance in mobile search, which correctly anticipated the market's response. \n",

If Googleâ€™s sites revenue increased by 18% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, with a 10% increase quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong mobile search performance, then the stock price is likely to rise the next trading day, because strong growth in core revenue streams indicates successful adaptation to market trends and investor confidence.  \n",

       "   'analysis': \"Google's Q4 2014 earnings report reveals strong revenue growth and positive operational metrics, with several factors likely influencing the next day's stock price. Relevant to the analysis are the facts of a 15% year-over-year revenue increase, strong performance in mobile search, and significant growth in YouTube's mobile revenue, which all indicate robust core business performance. These facts align with historical if-then statements suggesting that such strength typically results in a positive market reaction. However, there are counterbalancing factors to consider. The negative currency effects, albeit hedged, could slightly weigh on investor sentiment, as they suggest potential future earnings volatility due to macroeconomic factors. Furthermore, inventory issues related to Nexus 6 might raise concerns about operational execution, possibly tempering market enthusiasm despite strong overall performance. The company's significant real estate investments and reduced effective tax rate add positive signals about future growth capacity and effective financial management, which historically encourage a positive stock market reaction. Additionally, the sentiment from company speakersâ€”being cautiously optimisticâ€”presents a balanced view that acknowledges both current strengths and future challenges, potentially stabilizing immediate market reactions by not veering too heavily towards unrealistic optimism or pessimism. ###\"},\n",

       "   'analysis': \"The primary factors influencing Google's stock price movement can be derived from the company's strong financial performance in key growth areas, overcoming currency challenges, and an optimistic sentiment from company executives which could resonate well with investors. Key highlights include strong consolidated revenue growth of 17% year-over-year excluding currency effects, the significant growth in mobile search contributing to Google Site revenues, and increased engagement via paid clicks particularly through YouTube TrueView ads. The effect of adverse currency fluctuations was mitigated by hedging benefits but remains a concern. The increase of 25% in paid clicks due to YouTube ad growth, coupled with a 13% boost in overall paid clicks, implies substantial user engagement, which can positively drive future revenue. Additionally, the optimistic sentiment articulated by executives reinforces confidence in Google's strategies and growth potential despite some challenges. ###\"},\n",
